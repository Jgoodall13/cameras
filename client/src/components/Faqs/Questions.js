                    <AccordionItemBody>
                        <p>- A Time of Flight (TOF) camera uses a modulated light source (in our case an infrared VCSEL Laser) and a time resolved sensor to measure distance using the speed of light. Time of Flight technology has mm scale resolution and can be used to many meters of range.</p>
